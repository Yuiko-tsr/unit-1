## Reflection

# 1. What worked well?
* Learning basics of coding
  * Ways to use CSV, library, get method, function
* Being able to write code using easy functions
  * Using input/output, for loops, if statements, while statements
* Adding visual creativity into the code
  * Using color, underline
* Making my code without looking at Seniors' repositories
 
# 2. What did not work well?
* Keeping the code concise
  * My codes have a tendency of being long and repetitive with the same code being typed multiple times.
  * It ended up being longer than 200 lines and there was a lot of cutting I could have done.
* Importing outside websites into the terminal
  * I intended on importing online websites so the user can get an updated version of the currency rate but I did not have enough time...

# 3. What is your goal for unit 2?
* To make my code less than 100 lines
  * My goal is to use functions to make my code more concise.
* Master flow charts
  * I still struggle to make flow charts so I want to be able to make them without looking at past flow charts.

# 4. How do you plan on achieving that goal?
* By using functions to prevent repetition
* I will continue to practice through daily quizzes
